## 1. Implementation
- [x] 1.1 Add dependencies to `Cargo.toml` (alloy, tokio, tracing, dotenv, serde, etc.)
- [x] 1.2 Implement `src/constant.rs` with constants from `project.md` and placeholders.
- [x] 1.3 Implement `src/contracts/erc20.rs` with necessary ERC20 functions (approve, balance_of).
- [x] 1.4 Implement `src/strategies/vault.rs` with the core logic (read rate, compare, deposit/withdraw).
- [x] 1.5 Implement `src/main.rs` to wire everything together.
- [x] 1.6 Ensure `last_action_rate.txt` handling is correct.
